# üß† Attention Based Multiple Instance Learning for Generalizing on the UBC-OCEAN Dataset
## Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification and Outlier Detection (OCEAN)

### üìç Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and materials for my **M.Tech (AI & DS)** final project at **SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST)**, guided by **Dr. S. Ganesh Kumar**.  
The work was presented and published in the **Proceedings of ICMBNT 2025** under the title *"Optimizing an Attention-based MIL Architecture for Generalizing on the UBC-OCEAN"*.

### üß© Abstract
> Early and accurate diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer is crucial for timely intervention. AI-driven subtype classification addresses subjective variability in histopathological assessment and is key to treatment management. To improve applicability, rare subtypes need to be flagged as outliers. Whole slide images (WSIs) and Tissue Microarray (TMA) images from the UBC-OCEAN dataset were used for ovarian cancer subtyping. WSIs are large (600MB+) with sparsely distributed disease tissue, requiring careful feature extraction and use.  
> Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a form of weakly supervised learning, enables generalization on such datasets. Neural approaches like Attention-based MIL (ABMIL) offer interpretability and performance advantages. This work presents results from an optimized architecture using a **double Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone** pretrained on diverse pathology datasets with **self-supervised learning (Lunit DINO)**. The approach generalizes effectively to the diverse, unseen test set of the UBC-OCEAN dataset.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Insights
- Implemented and optimized an **Attention-based MIL (ABMIL)** architecture using **double Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones** with patch sizes 8√ó8 and 16√ó16.  
- Demonstrated improvement from a **[baseline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/skarthikguruswamy/inceptionv3-tl-classifier) private score of 0.26** (rank 855/1326) to **0.42**, matching the **top 10%** of the Kaggle leaderboard (ranks 132‚Äì159).  
- Leveraged **self-supervised pretrained pathology weights (Lunit DINO)** to enhance generalization without additional compute.  
- Utilized **entropy-based outlier detection** for rare ovarian cancer subtypes.  
- Achieved results aligned with **UN SDG 3 (Health)** and **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)** by improving diagnostic generalization across global datasets.
